# HeatingTest
An android app for managing custom modules added to the zway server from zwave.me.
Communicates directly with the raspberry pi zway hub. Retrieves and displays data about the central heating zones (rooms), the hot water zone and the lighting.
Also allows for control of the separate pump for delivery of the hot water.

So far, this app allows for the control of the central heating module which has been live for about a year.
More recently a lighting module has been added, this is limited to on/off status changes right now, but will have scheduling and grouping
added shortly.
